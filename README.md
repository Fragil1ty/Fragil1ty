## Timings
[6000 CL26:2133](https://ibb.co/5gMrXQ8L) </br>
[6000 CL28:2200](https://ibb.co/zWX9VV5p) </br>
[6200 CL28:2133](https://ibb.co/BXWzWQ0) </br>

These are timings I fluctuate between using, I'm currently dailying 6000:2200. IMC and kit specific but feel free to use them as a starting point.
As of <u>21/11/25</u>, I've now reverted back to these timings: https://ibb.co/q3691R1B. No performance loss vs 2200 and it just "feels" more stable.
