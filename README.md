## Fragility's tweaks, settings & more.

So this guide overs "advanced" PC optimisation settings that 'should' be commonly known. This guide aims to cover everything that you would get out of a normal optimisation appointment so that a.) It's going to save you time and money and b.) You're educating yourself to hopefully further pass on this knowledge. If everyone knows this stuff (which can be learnt in a 1-2 week period) then you don't have to trust someone else to do it for you.

## Operating System

* Linux? Still not an option in 2025. If you're on a full AMD system and you are really fed up of the direct that Microsoft is heading towards i.e. heavy AI integration, heavy telemetary and tracking based o/s? then sure, you could switch to Linux but you'll be FAFO'ing around a lot more than you would on Windows. Furthermore, you'll have to sacrifice playing some, if not all anti-cheat based games such as League, Valorant, BF6 and more. Not to mention if you're an NVIDIA user, a high-end NVIDIA user (5070Ti -> 5090) you're going to be looking at horrendous peformance vs using that GPU on Windows due to driver limitations. It's not worth the effort. Unless you have a very specific use-case for Linux? I wouldn't bother.

There is a lot of misinformation circuluating the internet on what the "best" BIOS settings are for AMD. I'm here to clear up what the best settings actually are. Refer to the screenshots below.
