I want to use this page to provide people with a reference point for part picking, overclocking tools & timings. </br>
I wont be hand holding, please use example settings (i.e. ram timings) with a grain of salt and use common sense. These are more of a guide and not a definitive statement on what you should or should not use. </br>
