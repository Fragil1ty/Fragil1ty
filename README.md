## Timings
[6000 CL26:2133](https://ibb.co/5gMrXQ8L) </br>
[6000 CL28:2167](https://ibb.co/q3691R1B) </br>
[6000 CL28:2200](https://ibb.co/zWX9VV5p) </br>
[6200 CL28:2133](https://ibb.co/BXWzWQ0) </br>

These are timings I fluctuate between using, I'm currently using 6000 CL28:2167. It's just about finding your sweet spot, so find out what works for you, what your sweetspots are and then just go from there.
